#Summary
All files here are OSD elements that are written in c++ (though they might have corresponding qml files under qml/widgets ? \
The reason they were written in c++ is Performance (pretty sure on this one).
They generally all inherit from QQuickPaintedItem and draw stuff via QPainter.

Note that only a small number of OSD elements is done in c++, the rest is qml.
